# Test Booking Flow

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Navigation Links**:

   - ✅ Fixed Header component to use Next.js `Link` components instead of `<a>` tags
   - ✅ All links now point to proper routes: Home (`/`), My Bookings (`/my-bookings`)
   - ✅ Both desktop and mobile navigation updated

2. **SeatNumber Undefined Errors**:

   - ✅ Fixed My Bookings page: `s.seat.seatNumber` → `s.seat?.seatNumber || "N/A"`
   - ✅ Fixed Payment page: Added fallbacks for `seat.seatNumber` and `seat.seatType`
   - ✅ Fixed BookingSeatSelection: Added fallback for `seat.seatNumber`
   - ✅ Fixed SeatSelection component: Added safety checks for all seat properties

3. **Data Structure Safety**:
   - ✅ All components now use optional chaining (`?.`) for nested properties
   - ✅ Fallback values provided for all undefined cases
   - ✅ API response structure is consistent with enhanced booking data

## Test Steps:

1. **Home Page Navigation**:

   - Click "My Bookings" in header → Should navigate to `/my-bookings`
   - Click "Home" → Should navigate to `/`

2. **Complete Booking Flow**:

   - Search for routes
   - Select a schedule
   - Choose seats (verify no seatNumber errors)
   - Fill passenger information
   - Complete payment (mock)
   - View confirmation page (all data should display)
   - Navigate to My Bookings via header
   - View booking in My Bookings list

3. **My Bookings Page**:
   - Should load without errors
   - Should display all booking information
   - Search functionality should work
   - "View Details" should navigate to confirmation page

## Expected Results:

- ✅ No "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'seatNumber')" errors
- ✅ Proper Next.js client-side navigation
- ✅ All passenger and seat information displays correctly
- ✅ My Bookings page accessible and functional
