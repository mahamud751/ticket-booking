# QR Code Scanner for Bus Staff - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The QR scanner page (`/qr-scanner`) provides bus staff with a professional tool to validate passenger tickets in real-time. This implementation includes both camera-based QR scanning and manual PNR entry.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Real QR Code Scanning
- **Camera Integration**: Uses `html5-qrcode` library for reliable QR code scanning
- **Auto-focus**: Automatically detects and decodes QR codes from passenger tickets
- **Error Handling**: Graceful camera permission handling and error recovery
- **Cross-platform**: Works on mobile devices and desktop browsers

### ✅ Manual PNR Entry
- **Backup Method**: Manual 6-digit PNR input as fallback
- **Auto-uppercase**: Automatically converts input to uppercase
- **Validation**: Real-time input validation and formatting

### ✅ Comprehensive Ticket Validation
- **Real-time API**: `/api/bookings/validate` endpoint for instant validation
- **Security Checks**: Validates booking status, payment status, and date validity
- **Multi-passenger Support**: Shows all passengers for group bookings
- **Detailed Information**: Complete booking, route, and passenger details

### ✅ Enhanced UI/UX
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear ✅ VALID / ❌ INVALID indicators
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded status indicators for booking and payment
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile devices (bus staff tablets/phones)
- **Professional Interface**: Clean, easy-to-use interface for bus operations

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/bookings/validate?pnr={PNR}`
Validates a ticket by PNR number and returns comprehensive booking information.

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "booking": {
    "id": "booking-id",
    "pnr": "TEST123",
    "status": "CONFIRMED",
    "paymentStatus": "COMPLETED",
    "passengerName": "John Doe",
    "passengerPhone": "+1234567890",
    "passengerEmail": "john.doe@example.com",
    "totalAmount": 50.00,
    "seatNumbers": ["A1", "A2"],
    "allPassengers": [
      {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "seatNumber": "A1"
      }
    ],
    "route": {
      "origin": "Dhaka",
      "destination": "Chittagong"
    },
    "schedule": {
      "departureTime": "2024-01-15T08:00:00Z",
      "arrivalTime": "2024-01-15T14:00:00Z",
      "busNumber": "BUS-001",
      "operator": "Green Line"
    },
    "isValid": true,
    "validationTimestamp": "2024-01-15T07:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### POST `/api/bookings/validate` (Optional)
Marks a ticket as validated/used for audit trail purposes.

## Validation Logic

A ticket is considered **VALID** if:
1. ✅ Booking exists in database
2. ✅ Booking status is "CONFIRMED"
3. ✅ Payment status is "COMPLETED"
4. ✅ At least one successful payment record exists
5. ✅ Departure date is today or in the future

A ticket is **INVALID** if any of the above conditions fail.

## QR Code Format Support

The scanner supports multiple QR code formats:
- **Simple PNR**: Just the PNR string (e.g., "TEST123")
- **JSON Format**: `{"pnr": "TEST123", "booking_id": "123"}`
- **Complex Data**: Any JSON containing a `pnr` or `PNR` field

## Usage Instructions for Bus Staff

### 🔍 Scanning Process
1. **Open Scanner**: Navigate to `/qr-scanner` or click "QR Scanner" in navigation
2. **Scan QR Code**: Tap "Scan QR Code" to activate camera
3. **Position Camera**: Point camera at passenger's ticket QR code
4. **Auto-validation**: System automatically validates and shows result
5. **Check Details**: Review passenger name, seat numbers, and validity status

### 📱 Manual Entry (Backup)
1. **Enter PNR**: Type the 6-digit PNR number manually
2. **Validate**: Click "Validate Ticket" button
3. **Review Results**: Check validation status and passenger details

### ✅ Validation Results
- **🟢 VALID**: Passenger can board - check ID matches name
- **🔴 INVALID**: Passenger cannot board - direct to customer service
- **📋 Details**: Review all passenger names for group bookings
